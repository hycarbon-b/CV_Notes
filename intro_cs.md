- ctrl+c terminate the process  
- ctrl+z pause the pocess:  
    fg resume in foreground  
    bg resume in background  
- jobs show the process  
- increment/decrement operators ++/-- with prefix and postfix
- assignment operators  
- different placeholder of %d, e.g. %6d %-6d  

- ctrl+d to generate EOF  
- random num in C  
    rand() return next random integer  
    srand(time(NULL)) set rand seed of rand()  

## Writing practice: C Language  
### 1. Introduction  
C language was developed at Bell Labs in the mid-1970s by Dennis Ritchi, which has become one of the most widely used programming language. Despite being over 50 years old, it still has lots of advantages in effciency, high controllability of hardware. In this article, we are going to introduce some basic concepts about programming and C language.  

### 2. Process of C  
- Source file   
    A c source file is a text file with specific grammer of c, which has `.c` as its extension name.  Source file contains the logic of program(algorithm) and other components making it can be understood by compiler.  
- Compile
    The source file from high-level language converts into machine code that can be understood by computer, this process is called `compile`. Compiler will generate `.o` object file after compiling.  
- Link  
    In this process, mutiple object files involved in the source file are combined to generate the final excutable file.  
- Excute   
    Run the executable file. The program will start from `main` function.

### 3. Syntax  
- variable   
- statement  
- function  & function used frequently  
- input & output 

### 4. Summary  

## Writing practice: What is "analysis"?
